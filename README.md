## Inspiration

My main inspiration to create this configuration was stream one of the AWS developer advocate [Darko Mesaros](https://github.com/darko-mesaros).
Recording from that session can be find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPnYFsXml-I).

There are some slight changes to initial configuration proposed in stream which apply to username and hostname diplayed on the bar.
To have current username and hostname during SSH sessions, I'd used
[tmux-config-screenshot](https://github.com/soyuka/tmux-current-pane-hostname)
plugin.
